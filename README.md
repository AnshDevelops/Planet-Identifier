# Planet-Identifier

This repository contains code for a project that aims to identify different planets in our solar system using image classification techniques. The project utilizes a dataset of planet images and implements a deep learning model for accurate identification.

## Dataset
The Kaggle dataset used in this project can be found [here]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emirhanai/planets-and-moons-dataset-ai-in-space'). It consists of images representing various planets in our solar system. Please note that I am using a slightly modified version of this dataset.
